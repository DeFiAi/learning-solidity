# Learning Solidity
Credits to the Willitscale/learning-solidity , for   training the GPT model for   summarising  the contracts , we will use the demo contracts with explanation for some of the demo contracts and will be eventually merged with the Smart-contracts-annotation-dataset.

- ada : an better alternative for more generalised explanation .
