# Learning Solidity
Credits to the Willitscale/learning-solidity , for   training the GPT model for   summarising  the contracts , we will use the demo contracts with explanation for some of the demo contracts and will be eventually merged with the Smart-contracts-annotation-dataset.


## Specifications for the summarisation tasks and parameters for the diffrent models 

credits : presentation by the [OpenAI developer manager](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7825991/video/477457514) and the [documentation of openAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/prompt-design-101). 


### Understanding cost analysis for diffrent models :


- Da vinci Model :  most trained model with highest parameters and tendency to formulate the  response in more consistent way , but there needs to be better co-analysis .



here we will be taking the most comprehenive model ( davinci ) as the standard , thus :


- ada : 10% of the DaV
- Babbage : 1% of the DaV 
- curie :   1/50 of DaV 



But still they have both benifits and short comings . they are great on regenerating and understanding the natural expression based patters ( for instances generating  smart  contracts with single use case ) . 










## Understanding of parameters 





temprature :


Frequency penalty :


Top P :

Best Of :





## Diffrent use case and correspondingly making the prompts:


Semantic search : doing efficient way of segmenting diffrent documents at same time 

  - understanding the specifics of the fine tuning 


- ada : an better alternative for more generalised explanation . 




## thus based on the analysis , the first beta can consider the following :
